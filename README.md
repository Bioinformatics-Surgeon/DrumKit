# JS30DrumKit

## About:
- This is the first exercise in Wes Bos's JS30 series. (https://wesbos.com/)
- We are to build a drum-kit based using only vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. 
- I hosted the sound.wav on my Cloudinary account as the content management system.
- I want to take the exercises on JS30 and apply my own style to them, beef them up and add more features from the base exercise.

## Future plans:
- Add 100+ sounds and allow uses to replace the default keys with their own choices from a dropdown of sounds
- Add a loop feature that allows user to create loops
- A feature that allows users to save their work
- Authentication 
- Download as mp3 format feature
